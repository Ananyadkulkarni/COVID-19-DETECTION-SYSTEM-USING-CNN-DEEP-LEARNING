ðŸš€ Unmasking COVID-19: AI-Powered X-Ray Detection with Flask ðŸš€

This isn't just another project; it's a critical step in accelerating COVID-19 detection using the power of artificial intelligence. Our system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the backbone of modern image recognition, to meticulously analyze chest X-ray images for signs of the virus.

How It Works

At its core, a highly optimized CNN model, built with TensorFlow and Keras, processes uploaded X-ray images. It's trained on vast datasets to discern subtle patterns and anomalies indicative of COVID-19, delivering a rapid and informed prediction.

Seamless Accessibility with Flask

To make this powerful AI accessible, we've wrapped it in a user-friendly Flask web application. Users can easily upload X-ray images directly through their browser. But we've gone a step further: the app also includes functionality to simulate camera-based X-ray capture. This demonstrates a potential real-world workflow, allowing for the immediate processing of images as they are "captured," making the system incredibly versatile for various diagnostic scenarios.

Our Mission

Our primary goal is to provide a rapid, AI-driven preliminary screening tool. While not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis, this system acts as a valuable assistant, helping to expedite the diagnostic process and reduce the burden on healthcare systems. It showcases the immense potential of deep learning in revolutionizing medical diagnostics and underscores how technology can serve humanity in critical times.
